# ðŸŒ ðŸŒŒ 07 Project-1: Comet Watch ðŸŒŒðŸŒ 

## Description
**Comet Watch** is a web page where the user will find interesting data about near earth objects. This project was built thinking of users who love **Asteroids** and would like to know more. Data will include dates, estimated diameter, potential impacts and more!

## Installation
To get our Project running, we used an API from NASA, this API is called **NeoWs**, which stands for "Near Earth OBject Web Service". This API provided all the Asteroids' data in our web page.

To ensure **Comet Watch** was appealing to our users we implemented the use of a second API - Astronomy Picure of the Day API. This generates a random image based on the date the user has chosen which is incoperated into a fixed image carousel. 
 
## User Story
As a user with a passionate interest in Comet's and anything galaxy related. I want to be able to select a date of choice then view a list of near Earth objects with interesting facts. When the date is chosen, a fascinating image will be displayed for each day!

## Expected Behaviour
1. User can select a date using the on screen form 
2. A list of near earth objects for chosen date is generated and displayed in the table with facts  
3. Local storage is utilised by storing previous dates selected
4. Astronomy picture of the day is displayed on the front page
