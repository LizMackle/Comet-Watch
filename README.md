## Description

**Comet Watch** is a web page where the user will  find interesting data about those Asteroids that have come near to Earth.

This website, makes this information available and easy to read for everyone. Asteroids are so interesting and fun!

## Installation

<!-- What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. -->
To get our Project running, we used an API from NASA, this API is called **NeoWs**, which stands for "Near Earth OBject Web Service". This API provided all the Asteroids' data in our web page. 

To ensure **Comet Watch** was appealing to our users we implemented the use of Tailwind CSS.
