# ðŸŒ ðŸŒŒ 07 Project-1: Comet Watch ðŸŒŒðŸŒ 

## Description
**Comet Watch** is a web page where the user will find interesting data about near earth objects. This projet was built thinking of users who love **Asteroids** and would like to know. Data will include dates, distance they approached the Earth, estimated diameter, potencial impacts and more! 

## Installation
To get our Project running, we used an API from NASA, this API is called **NeoWs**, which stands for "Near Earth OBject Web Service". This API provided all the Asteroids' data in our web page.

To ensure **Comet Watch** was appealing to our users we implemented the use of Tailwind CSS, JQuery and Javascript.
 
## User Story
As a user with a passionate interest in Comet's and anything galaxy related. I want to be able to select a date of choice then view a list of near Earth objects with interesting data. A saved search history is also displayed for easy access when returning back to the site.

## Expected Behaviour
1. User can select a date using the on screen form 
2. A list of near earth objects for chosen date is generated and displayed in the table with facts  
3. Local storage is utilised by storing previous dates selected
4. Astronomy picture of the day is displayed on the front page
